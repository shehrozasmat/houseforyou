# Fix for npm ci Error

## Issue
The GitHub workflow is failing because `npm ci` is reporting that some dependencies are missing from the package-lock.json file, even though they appear to be present. The error message is:

```
npm error Missing: gh-pages@6.3.0 from lock file
npm error Missing: async@3.2.6 from lock file
npm error Missing: commander@13.1.0 from lock file
...
```

## Solution
The issue can be resolved by regenerating the package-lock.json file. A script has been provided to do this:

1. Run the regenerate-lock-file.sh script:
   ```bash
   ./regenerate-lock-file.sh
   ```

2. This script will:
   - Remove the existing package-lock.json file
   - Run npm install to generate a new package-lock.json file

3. After the script completes, commit the new package-lock.json file:
   ```bash
   git add package-lock.json
   git commit -m "Regenerate package-lock.json to fix npm ci error"
   git push
   ```

4. The GitHub workflow should now run successfully.

## Why This Works
The `npm ci` command requires that the package.json and package-lock.json files are in sync. Sometimes, the lock file can become corrupted or out of sync in ways that aren't immediately apparent. Regenerating the lock file ensures that it correctly reflects the dependencies specified in package.json.
